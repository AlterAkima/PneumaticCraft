-Greatly improved the Programmer's area render (the green cubes) performance. It'll now allow any size area to be rendered.
-Showing the Programmer's area is now toggled instead of time based. A button to show the area, another to hide it.

-Bugfix: Omnidirectional Hopper stacks items which have a different NBT value.
-Bugfix: Programmer doesn't properly sync.
