-Hackers who fail to hack a Security Station now get hurt 9.5 hearts of damage.
-Added German localization (incomplete), thanks Cakestory!
-Drones now will teleport to a location if they can't reach it flying. This costs time and a lot of pressure, and is more a last resort against lag. This fixes various bugs.

-Bugfix: Assembly IO Unit tries to extract items from inventories that have ghost items only (like locked Jabba barrels).
-Bugfix: Log errors when using Steve's Production's crafting.
-Bugfix: Pressure Chamber interface crashes when in Creative Tab filter mode and an item without a Creative Tab tries to be filtered.
