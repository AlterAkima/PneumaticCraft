-Added Redstone Flux converters (Pneumatic Dynamo and Flux Compressor).
-Added liquid XP pumping in/out of the Aerial Interface (works with OpenBlocks' Liquid XP and MFR's Mob Essence).
-Refactored GUI code (can cause minor derps, bug reports are appreciated!)
-Finally got rid of all possibilities of getting plastic plant seeds with a weird meta value.

Bugfix: GPS Tool doesn't work when either the X, Y or Z is 0.
