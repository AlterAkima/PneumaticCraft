-Greatly improved the Programmer's area render (the green cubes) performance. It'll now allow any size area to be rendered.
-Showing the Programmer's area is now toggled instead of time based. A button to show the area, another to hide it.
-GPS Tool now shows the selected coordinate when held.
-Liquid Hopper now fills/empties any liquid container at the output/input side respectively.
-Liquid Hopper now sucks liquid blocks at the input and places liquid blocks at the output when a Dispenser Upgrade is inserted.
-Added MFR plant compatibility.
-Added pt_BR localization (thanks MrKunji!)

-Bugfix: Omnidirectional Hopper stacks items which have a different NBT value.
-Bugfix: Programmer doesn't properly sync.
